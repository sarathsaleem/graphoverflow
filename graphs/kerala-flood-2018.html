            The normal cumulative rainfall during monsoons in Kerala from June till end of August is around
            <b>1795.4 mm</b>, but this monsoon got an actual cumulative rainfall more than

            Pulling out the records of the last 140 years, Dr Arvind Srivastava, director of IMD, explained the

            "The highest rainfall in Kerala occurred in 1907, that was

                Meteorologists say that the rainfall data over the last six years do not suggest a visible pattern.
                After a peak in 2013, rainfall in the state dipped in 2014 and hit a low in 2015 before slowly rising
                in 2016, 2017 and
                2018. In 2013, all the state’s districts, except Thiruvananthapuram, received more than 1400 mm of
                rainfall.
                Kannur, with 3119.4 mm, got the most rain. “It is due to the inter-annual variability and changes in
                climatic conditions,” said D Sivananda Pai, who is the head of the Climatic Prediction Group at the
                India Meteorological
                Department in Pune.
