had any illusions about
leaving that island alive,

so three days before the Japanese
took the island,

969
01:06:32,463 --> 01:06:37,696
your granddad asked
a gunner on an Air Force transport,
name of Winocki--

970
01:06:37,769 --> 01:06:40,704

in his life--

971

put in a Vietnamese prison camp.

He knew if the gooks
ever saw the watch,

980
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:26,007
it'd be confiscated,
taken away.

981

The way your dad looked at it,
this watch was your birthright.

982

gonna put their greasy, yellow
hands on his boy's birthright,

he could hide something-- his ass.

- Jimmie.
- Uh-huh.

Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I
smelled some coffee back there.

1768
02:03:24,874 --> 02:03:28,310
- Would you make me a cup?
- Uh, yeah, sure.

1769
02:03:29,779 --> 02:03:32,714
Oh, uh, um,
how do you take it?

1770
02:03:32,782 --> 02:03:35,342
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

1771
02:03:37,420 --> 02:03:40,856
About the car, is there anything
I need to know? Does it stall?

1772
02:03:40,924 --> 02:03:44,360
Does it smoke? Does it make
a lot of noise? ls there gas in it?

1773
02:03:44,427 --> 02:03:47,863
- Aside from how it looks,
the car's cool.
- Positive?

1774
02:03:47,931 --> 02:03:51,367
Don't get me on the road and I find out
the brake lights don't work.

1775
02:03:51,434 --> 02:03:55,495
- As far as I know,
the motherfucker's tip-top.
- Good enough.

1776
02:03:55,572 --> 02:03:57,597

- Thank you, Jimmie.

1779
02:04:11,020 --> 02:04:12,954
Mmm.

1780
02:04:14,023 --> 02:04:16,150
Okay, first thing.
You two.

1781
02:04:16,226 --> 02:04:19,161
Take the body,
stick it in the trunk.

1782
02:04:19,229 --> 02:04:21,959
This looks to be
a pretty domesticated house.

1783
02:04:22,031 --> 02:04:25,967
- That would lead me to believe
you got cleansers and shit.
- Yeah. Under the sink.

1784
02:04:26,035 --> 02:04:29,471
Good. What I need you two fellas to do
is take those cleaning products...

1785
02:04:29,539 --> 02:04:33,566
and clean the inside of the car--
I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.

1786
02:04:33,643 --> 02:04:37,579
Go in the back seat, scoop up all
those little pieces of brain and skull.

1787
02:04:37,647 --> 02:04:40,582
Get it out of there.
Wipe down the upholstery.

1788
02:04:40,650 --> 02:04:43,585
It don't need to be spick-and-span.
You don't need to eat off it.

1789
02:04:43,653 --> 02:04:48,022
Just give it a good once-over.
What you need to take care of
are the really messy parts.

1790
02:04:48,091 --> 02:04:52,187
The pools of blood that have collected,
you gotta soak that shit up.

1791
02:04:52,262 --> 02:04:54,696
We need to raid
your linen closet.

1792
02:04:54,764 --> 02:04:57,699
I need blankets,
I need comforters, quilts, bedspreads.

1793
02:04:57,767 --> 02:05:01,396
The thicker the better,
the darker the better.
No whites. Can't use 'em.

1794
02:05:01,471 --> 02:05:06,773
We'll need to camouflage the front seat
and back seat and floorboards...

1795
02:05:06,843 --> 02:05:08,777
with quilts and blankets,

1796
02:05:08,845 --> 02:05:12,781
so if a cop starts stickin'
his big snout in the car,
the subterfuge won't last,

1797
02:05:12,849 --> 02:05:15,716
but at a glance the car
will appear to be normal.

1798
02:05:15,785 --> 02:05:17,844
Jimmie, lead the way.
Boys, get to work.

1799
02:05:17,921 --> 02:05:19,684
"Please" would be nice.

1800
02:05:21,157 --> 02:05:24,092
- Come again?
- I said, a "please" would be nice.

1801
02:05:25,995 --> 02:05:29,829
Get it straight, buster.
I'm not here to say please.
I'm here to tell you what to do.

1802
02:05:31,634 --> 02:05:34,569
And if self-preservation
is an instinct you possess,

1803
02:05:34,637 --> 02:05:37,071
you'd better fuckin' do it
and do it quick.

1804
02:05:37,140 --> 02:05:41,042
I'm here to help. If my help's
not appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.

1805
02:05:41,110 --> 02:05:44,443
No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that;
your help is definitely appreciated.

1806
02:05:44,514 --> 02:05:47,449
Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't
mean disrespect, okay? I respect you.

1807
02:05:47,517 --> 02:05:50,315
I just don't like people
barkin' orders at me.

1808
02:05:50,386 --> 02:05:53,446
If I'm curt with you,
it's because time is a factor.

1809
02:05:53,523 --> 02:05:58,153
I think fast, I talk fast,
and I need you guys to act fast
if you wanna get out of this.

02:05:58,227 --> 02:06:01,663
So pretty please, with sugar on top,
clean the fuckin' car.

Don't be lookin' at me like that,
all right? I can feel your look.

- No, no, please. Go ahead.

- Unless you do it first.

How about you, Lash LaRue?
Can you keep your spurs
from jingling and jangling?

What is it?

2075

- Let go of him, or I'm gonna kill you!
- Tell that bitch to be cool.

2081

- Say, "Bitch, be cool!"
Say, "Bitch, be cool!"

- Now tell me her name.
- Yolanda.

2088
02:22:41,427 --> 02:22:44,863
All right, now, Yolanda, we're not
gonna do anything stupid, are we?

2089
02:22:44,930 --> 02:22:47,865
- Don't you hurt him!
- Nobody's gonna hurt anybody!

We're all gonna be like three little
Fonzies here. And what's Fonzie like?

- Come on, Yolanda!
What's Fonzie like?
- He's cool.

- Cool.

Correctamundo.
And that's what we're gonna be.

2094
02:23:00,146 --> 02:23:02,080
We're gonna be cool.

2095
02:23:02,148 --> 02:23:07,051
Now, Ringo,
I'm gonna count to three.

2096
02:23:07,119 --> 02:23:09,212
And when I count three,

2097
02:23:09,288 --> 02:23:12,223
I want you to
let go of your gun,

2098
02:23:12,291 --> 02:23:15,749
put your palms flat on the table
and sit your ass down.

2099
02:23:16,829 --> 02:23:18,888
And when you do it,

You ready?

- [ Panting ] Okay, now you let him go!
- Yolanda!

2106
02:23:40,052 --> 02:23:43,647
I thought you were gonna
be cool. Now, when you yell
at me, it makes me nervous.

2107
02:23:43,722 --> 02:23:45,815
When I get nervous,
I get scared.

2108
02:23:45,891 --> 02:23:49,725
When motherfuckers get scared,
that's when motherfuckers
accidentally get shot.

2109
02:23:51,363 --> 02:23:54,992
Just know, you hurt him, you die.

2110
02:23:55,067 --> 02:23:58,468
Well, that seems to be
the situation.

2111
02:23:58,537 --> 02:24:00,471
But I don't want that.

2112
02:24:00,539 --> 02:24:02,473
And you don't want that.

2113
02:24:02,541 --> 02:24:05,271
And Ringo here definitely
doesn't want that.

2114
02:24:05,344 --> 02:24:07,437
So let's see what we can do.

2115
02:24:09,849 --> 02:24:13,080
Now... here's the situation.

2116
02:24:13,152 --> 02:24:17,020
Normally both your asses would be
dead as fuckin' fried chicken,

2117
02:24:17,089 --> 02:24:20,525
but you happened to pull this shit
while I'm in a transitional period,

2118
02:24:20,593 --> 02:24:23,528
and I don't wanna kill you;
I wanna help you.

2119
02:24:23,596 --> 02:24:27,532
But I can't give you this case,
'cause it don't belong to me.

2120
02:24:27,600 --> 02:24:30,535
Besides, I been through too much shit
over this case this morning...

2121
02:24:30,603 --> 02:24:33,538
to just hand it over
to your dumb ass.

- Be cool! Yolanda, it's cool, baby.
- Get back!

2124
02:24:38,544 --> 02:24:41,240
It's cool!
We still just talkin'.

2125
02:24:41,313 --> 02:24:45,477
- Come on. Point the gun at me.
Point the gun at me. There you go.

2126
02:24:45,551 --> 02:24:47,610
Now, Vincent, you just hang back...

2127
02:24:47,686 --> 02:24:49,620
and don't do
a goddamn thing.

2128
02:24:49,688 --> 02:24:51,622
Tell her it's still cool.

2129
02:24:51,690 --> 02:24:54,625
- It's still cool, Honey Bunny.
- How we doin', baby?

2130
02:24:56,028 --> 02:24:58,690
I-- I gotta go pee.

2131
02:24:58,764 --> 02:25:00,698
I wanna go home.

2132
02:25:00,766 --> 02:25:04,361
Hang in there, baby. I'm proud of you.
And Ringo's proud of you.

2133
02:25:04,436 --> 02:25:07,371
It's almost over.
Tell her you're proud of her.

2134
02:25:07,439 --> 02:25:10,806
- I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny.
- I love you.

2135
02:25:10,876 --> 02:25:14,039
- I love you too, Honey Bunny.
- Now,

2136
02:25:14,113 --> 02:25:18,049
I want you to go in that bag
and find my wallet.

2137
02:25:20,586 --> 02:25:24,522
- Which one is it?
- It's the one that says
"Bad Motherfucker."

2138
02:25:38,783 --> 02:25:41,343
That's it.
That's my bad motherfucker.

2139
02:25:41,419 --> 02:25:44,513
Open it up.
Take out the money.

2140
02:25:49,560 --> 02:25:51,721
[ Jules ]
Count it.

2141
02:25:58,035 --> 02:26:00,560
How much is there?

2142
02:26:02,473 --> 02:26:04,407
About 1,500 dollars.

2143
02:26:04,475 --> 02:26:07,672
Okay, put it in your pocket.
It's yours.

2144
02:26:07,745 --> 02:26:10,942
Now, with the rest
of those wallets and the register,

2145
02:26:11,015 --> 02:26:13,108
that makes this a pretty successful
little score, huh?

2146
02:26:13,184 --> 02:26:17,086
Jules, you give that fuckin'
nimrod 1,500 dollars, and I'll
shoot him on general principle.

2147

do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing!

- Shut up!
- Come on, Yolanda. Stay with me, baby.

to him, Vincent.

- What?

so I don't have to kill your ass.

Not regularly, no.

2156
02:26:46,784 --> 02:26:49,218
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.

2157
02:26:49,287 --> 02:26:52,814
Ezekiel 25:17.

2158
02:26:52,890 --> 02:26:55,723
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...

2159
02:26:55,793 --> 02:26:57,727
by the inequities
of the selfish...

2160
02:26:57,795 --> 02:26:59,729
and the tyranny of evil men.

2161
02:26:59,797 --> 02:27:03,164
Blessed is he who,
in the name of charity and good will,

2162
02:27:03,234 --> 02:27:05,668
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

2163
02:27:05,736 --> 02:27:09,832
for he is truly his brother's keeper
and the finder of lost children.

2164
02:27:09,907 --> 02:27:14,207
And I will strike down upon thee with
great vengeance and furious anger...

2165
02:27:14,278 --> 02:27:17,338
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers.

2166
02:27:17,415 --> 02:27:20,441
And you will know
I am the Lord...

2167

when I lay My vengeance
upon you."

2168
02:27:25,156 --> 02:27:27,590
I been sayin' that shit for years,

2169
02:27:27,658 --> 02:27:30,821
and if you heard it,
that meant your ass.

2170
02:27:30,895 --> 02:27:33,830
I never gave much thought
to what it meant.

2171
02:27:33,898 --> 02:27:36,833
I just thought it was some coldblooded
shit to say to a motherfucker...

2172
02:27:36,901 --> 02:27:39,335
before I popped a cap
in his ass.

2173
02:27:39,403 --> 02:27:42,839
But I saw some shit this morning
made me think twice.

2174
02:27:42,907 --> 02:27:45,842
See, now I'm thinkin'
maybe it means...

2175
02:27:45,910 --> 02:27:50,779
you're the evil man,
and I'm the righteous man,

2176
02:27:50,848 --> 02:27:53,783
and Mr. 9-millimeter here,
he's the shepherd...

2177
02:27:53,851 --> 02:27:57,412
protecting my righteous ass
in the valley of darkness.

2178
02:27:57,488 --> 02:27:59,422
Or it could mean...

2179
02:27:59,490 --> 02:28:02,926
you're the righteous man,
and I'm the shepherd,

2180
02:28:02,994 --> 02:28:06,930
and it's the world
that's evil and selfish.

2181
02:28:06,998 --> 02:28:09,262
Now, I'd like that.

2182
02:28:09,333 --> 02:28:12,234
But that shit
ain't the truth.

2183
02:28:12,303 --> 02:28:14,168
The truth is,

02:28:15,239 --> 02:28:17,173
you're the weak...

2185
02:28:18,576 --> 02:28:21,977
and I'm the tyranny
of evil men.

But I'm tryin', Ringo.
